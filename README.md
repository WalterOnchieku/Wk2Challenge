WEEK 2 CHALLENGE: Interactive Shopping List

The goal of this project is to Develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

the index.js file has a function to input data from the field into an array. a second function takes the array, and converts it into a <p> element and displays it in html. the third unction deletes the contents of the array.

the style .css file adds style to the html content and assists with the mark as purchased button to indicate the text as purchased.
